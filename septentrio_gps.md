The septentrio GPS module has been set up using the [septentrio-gps repository](https://gitlab.com/roxautomation/components/septentrio-gps) from ROX automation. 

The configuration of the septentrio can be accessed via http://192.168.111.149:9000/ assuming you are connected to the Almighty wifi network.

When the ethernet cable is connected to the GPS module, the interface can also be accessed via http://192.168.111.101/
